"""A frozen, named, held-out eval-seed regression set for SharpeArena.

Procgen ships ``EXPLORATION_LEVEL_SEEDS`` — a tiny dict of named, fixed, hard single
seeds forming a stable evaluation set. Ported here: :data:`EVAL_SEEDS` is a committed,
versioned set of named scenario seeds that form a never-trained-on regression suite.
A deterministic reference policy rolled over each seed produces pinned SharpeBench
scores; :func:`assert_no_regression` gates CI on any drift versus a committed snapshot.

This is the EVAL-level complement to the Rust ``generate_scenario`` golden-hash: that
asserts byte-identity of the generated market; this asserts the *scored* outcome of a
fixed policy on the held-out band is stable across generator/kernel changes.

Every seed lives at/above :data:`EVAL_SEED_BASE`, so the set is provably disjoint from
the train band ``[0, EVAL_SEED_BASE)``. Because the seeds are already absolute held-out
values, the env is constructed with ``mode="train"`` (seed offset 0) and the absolute
seed passed straight through — ``mode="eval"`` would add ``EVAL_SEED_BASE`` again and
double-offset the scenario.

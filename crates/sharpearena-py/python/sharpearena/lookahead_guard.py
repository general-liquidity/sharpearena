"""Leak-free at the agent/harness boundary.

SharpeArena's leak-free guarantee is *structural* — the native env only ever emits a
point-in-time :class:`MarketObservation` (trailing closes up to the decision date), so a
policy literally cannot observe a future bar. :class:`LookaheadGuard` extends that
guarantee one layer out, to the agent harness, the way PrimeIntellect ``rlm`` refuses
broad git-history reads to stop a coding agent from reading the answer key. It is a
*refusal layer*: a deny-list of operations that would read future bars, the full
underlying series, the scenario answer key, or the scenario internals.

The pattern-matching here is **defense-in-depth behind the env's structural guarantee**,
not the guarantee itself — a harness that bypasses the guard still cannot make the env
leak. The point is to catch a misconfigured tool / policy that *tries* to, loudly, and to
keep legitimate analytics on PAST observations unobstructed.

"""A stateless, functional-RL view of SharpeArena via the *replay model*.

Gymnasium's :class:`~gymnasium.experimental.functional.FuncEnv` describes a *pure*
environment as five free functions over an explicit ``state`` value::

    initial(rng, params)                       -> state
    transition(state, action, rng, params)     -> state
    observation(state, rng, params)            -> obs
    reward(state, action, next_state, rng, p)  -> float
    terminal(state, rng, params)               -> bool

SharpeArena's native engine is a deterministic, point-in-time transition: given a seed
and an ordered sequence of decisions, the produced observations / rewards / done-flags
are byte-identical on replay. That property lets us model the FuncEnv ``state`` as a
**plain immutable tuple** ``(seed, actions)`` where ``actions`` is the tuple of decisions
taken so far. There is *no* hidden mutable engine state living in the FuncEnv:

* ``initial``    -> ``(seed, ())``
* ``transition`` -> ``(seed, actions + (action,))`` (append-only, returns a new tuple)
* ``observation`` / ``reward`` / ``terminal`` -> build a fresh :class:`SharpeArenaEnv`
  at ``seed``, replay ``actions`` through it, and decode the result.

Because the state is just ``seed + decisions`` (no engine handle, no numpy buffers), it
is picklable and usable as a tree-search node key, and the *only* thing that can affect a
rollout is the seed and the decision path — a strictly stronger leak guarantee than the
stateful :class:`SharpeArenaEnv` offers.

Honest JAX limitation
---------------------
``transition`` / ``observation`` / ``reward`` / ``terminal`` call into the native
(Rust/pyo3) binding through :class:`SharpeArenaEnv`. They are therefore **NOT**
``jax.jit`` / ``jax.vmap`` traceable: there is no JAX acceleration here and you cannot
wrap this in :class:`gymnasium.experimental.functional_jax_env.FunctionalJaxEnv`
(which requires JAX-array-pure functions). A JAX-native engine is a separate, future
build. What this module *does* deliver is the genuine stateless FuncEnv **contract**,
the stronger leak guarantee, and compatibility with functional-RL tooling and tree
search that key on an immutable, picklable state.

The replay cost is O(len(actions)) per ``observation`` / ``reward`` call (a full rebuild
+ replay). That is acceptable for tree search and functional rollouts of modest depth;
for long throughput-bound rollouts use the stateful :class:`SharpeArenaEnv` directly.

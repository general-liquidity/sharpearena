"""Tests for the baseline policies + leaderboard runner.

When the native binding and numpy are importable these exercise a real (small)
baseline sweep against the SharpeBench kernel. When the binding is absent the file
still imports and the dependency-light logic (markdown rendering, policy shapes) is
checked directly.

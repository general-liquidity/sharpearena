# OpenOutcry

### The point-in-time environment for trading agents, and the contract they speak

*Whoever defines the agent interface owns the ecosystem. OpenOutcry is the leak-free trading floor every agent runs on, and the language-agnostic contract that makes any agent scorable.*

## Why

An eval is useless without an environment. A benchmark scores *trajectories*; something has to **produce** them. OpenOutcry is that producer: a leak-free, point-in-time market environment wrapped in a dead-simple, language-agnostic agent contract. **The harness sends an `Observation`, the agent returns a `Decision`, repeat.**

Two properties make it trustworthy rather than a toy:

1. **Look-ahead is structurally impossible.** The environment owns the time cursor and the data layer has *no API to read a future bar*, so an agent cannot peek by construction, not by policing.
2. **Trajectories are recompute-from-raw-decisions.** A run records only the agent's decisions; a separate verifier replays them against the frozen data to recompute a **byte-identical** result. A tampered trajectory recomputes differently, so an agent cannot lie about its returns.

The strategic bet is **interface ownership**: if every trading agent in the open ecosystem conforms to OpenOutcry's `Observation`/`Decision` contract, then [SharpeBench](https://crates.io/crates/sharpebench-core) is the natural scorer and the whole funnel (env, trajectory, score, leaderboard) runs on one standard. This is the OpenAI-Gym moment for trading agents. The interface *is* the product; the simulator is the credibility behind it.

> An agent is just a program that reads an observation and writes a decision, in any language. Conform to the contract, and you are scorable everywhere.

## Status: published, active (pre-1.0)

Published to **crates.io**, **npm**, and **PyPI** at **v0.1.0**, depending on the **published** `sharpebench-sim 0.0.7` engine (not a vendored copy). CI is green across four surfaces: Rust (`fmt`, `clippy -D warnings`, tests, a WASM target build), `cargo-deny`, the npm package, and the Python wheel (`maturin` + `pytest`).

Beyond the core `reset`/`step` lifecycle, the environment now ships a full **reinforcement-learning training surface**:

| Capability | What it is |
|:--|:--|
| **Procedural scenarios** | A seeded generator (`ScenarioSpec` / `generate_scenario`) using Procgen's integer-seed-interval model, with `Calm` / `Hard` / `Extreme` volatility-and-jump tiers and provably disjoint `train_test_split`, cross-runtime golden-hashed for byte-identical generation. |
| **Generalization gap** | `generalization_gap` measures train-vs-held-out deflated Sharpe over disjoint seed bands, turning "did it overfit" into one number scored by the SharpeBench kernel. |
| **`verifiers` training env** | A PrimeIntellect `verifiers` `MultiTurnEnv` that steps the market bar-by-bar, over a multi-row scenario `Dataset`, with an `XMLParser` decision protocol and a GRPO-safe bounded reward scored by the real SharpeBench `score_run` (deflated Sharpe, pass^k, process checks). |
| **Vectorized rollouts** | `VecTradingEnv` runs B scenario lanes in lockstep (rayon, structure-of-arrays JSON, current-Gymnasium `AutoresetMode`), exposed as a `gymnasium.vector` env. |
| **Point-in-time-safe wrappers** | Causal normalize (no future-bar leak), `TimeLimit`, `FrameStack`, `RecordEpisodeStatistics`, vector-env variants, and `flatten`/`unflatten` Dict-obs helpers, plus a `check_env` conformance harness that *proves* seed-determinism (and adopts Gymnasium's own `check_env`). |
| **Gymnasium registration** | Versioned, namespaced IDs: `gymnasium.make("OpenOutcry/Hard-v1")` and `make_vec(...)` route to the scalar and vector envs, with `-Eval-v1` variants on a disjoint held-out seed band. |
| **Multi-agent markets** | A PettingZoo `MultiAgentOpenOutcryEnv` (batched competition: N agents on one frozen scenario, SharpeBench-ranked), and `EndogenousMarketEnv`, a real shared-book market where aggregate flow *moves* the cleared price (Kyle permanent + Almgren-Chriss temporary impact). |
| **Per-scenario mandates** | Each scenario samples a trading mandate (long-only, market-neutral, drawdown-capped, beat-a-benchmark); the `verifiers` rubric is mandate-conditioned, so wrong-objective behavior is penalized, not just unrewarded. |
| **Offline-RL + checkpointing** | `to_minari` exports rollouts as a Farama [Minari](https://minari.farama.org) dataset (leak-safe, `recover_environment`-ready); `CheckpointableEnv` clones/restores/branches market state for tree search; `OpenOutcryFuncEnv` is a stateless `gymnasium.functional.FuncEnv` view. |
| **Benchmark protocol** | A committed [`EVALUATION.md`](EVALUATION.md): the canonical eval contract, the disjoint train/held-out split, and a baseline leaderboard (deflated Sharpe to beat is 0.0; pass^k degrades Calm to Hard to Extreme). |
| **Harness integration** | An MCP server (`reset` / `step` / `spec` tools) so any MCP agent harness drives an episode with zero glue, a `LookaheadGuard` that refuses agent operations reading future data, versioned JSONL rollout traces that re-score offline through the SharpeBench kernel, and a cost-adjusted `RunMetrics` block for leaderboard ranking. |

The determinism-critical core (the engine, scoring, scenario generation, mandates, the market-clearing model, the execution-noise integrity knob) lives in **Rust** so a published number is byte-identical across every surface; the per-ecosystem adapters (gymnasium, PettingZoo, Minari, verifiers, MCP) are thin and live in the language each ecosystem speaks.

**Not yet shipped:** the [PrimeIntellect](https://app.primeintellect.ai) Environments-Hub listing and the Gordon conforming-agent adapter.

## Quickstart

```bash
cargo add openoutcry        # the Rust crate (re-exports the engine + the wire contract)
```

```rust
use openoutcry::{TradingEnv, Dataset, CostModel, Window, BuyAndHold, Agent};

let data = Dataset::synthetic(4, 120, 1);
let mut env = TradingEnv::new(data, Window { start: 20, end: 120 }, CostModel::default(), 7);
let mut agent = BuyAndHold;
let mut obs = env.reset();
loop {
    let decision = agent.decide(&obs);
    let step = env.step(decision);     // -> { observation, reward, done, info }
    obs = step.observation;
    if step.done { break; }
}
```

Both stepping surfaces (the open-loop `TradingEnv` and the closed-loop `run_backtest`) call one shared per-step body, so a trajectory the env produces is **byte-identical** to the equivalent backtest, enforced by a test.

```python
import gymnasium, openoutcry          # a first-class Gymnasium env
env = openoutcry.OpenOutcryEnv(n_symbols=4, n_days=120, seed=1)
obs, info = env.reset(seed=1)         # the seed selects the scenario
obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
```

## Train an agent

The Python package is a PrimeIntellect `verifiers` environment, so an agent trains over a distribution of leak-free scenarios scored by the SharpeBench kernel:

```python
import openoutcry

# A multi-turn env that steps the market bar-by-bar over many seeded scenarios.
env = openoutcry.load_environment(n_windows=256, n_symbols=4, n_days=120)

# Measure overfitting directly: train vs a provably disjoint held-out seed band.
gap = openoutcry.generalization_gap(
    lambda seed: openoutcry.OpenOutcryEnv(n_symbols=4, n_days=120, seed=seed),
    n_train=64, n_test=64,
)
print(gap["gap_deflated_sharpe"])
```

**Scale with vectorized rollouts.** `OpenOutcryVectorEnv` steps `B` independent scenario lanes in lockstep (rayon under the hood), exposing the standard `gymnasium.vector` API:

```python
import numpy as np, openoutcry

vec = openoutcry.OpenOutcryVectorEnv(num_envs=64, n_symbols=4, n_days=120)
obs, infos = vec.reset()
actions = np.full((vec.num_envs, len(vec.symbols)), 0.25, dtype=np.float32)
obs, rewards, terminated, truncated, infos = vec.step(actions)   # arrays of length 64
```

**Compose point-in-time-safe wrappers.** Standard gym wrappers, but the normalizers are *causal*, so no future bar ever leaks into the running statistics:

```python
import openoutcry
from openoutcry import TimeLimit, CausalNormalizeObservation, RecordEpisodeStatistics

env = RecordEpisodeStatistics(            # info["episode"] carries Sharpe + max drawdown
    CausalNormalizeObservation(
        TimeLimit(openoutcry.OpenOutcryEnv(n_symbols=4, n_days=120), max_episode_steps=64)
    )
)
```

**Register it like any Gymnasium env.** Importing `openoutcry` registers versioned IDs, so the whole RL ecosystem reaches it through muscle memory:

```python
import gymnasium, openoutcry
env = gymnasium.make("OpenOutcry/Hard-v1")            # difficulty + version pinned in the ID
vec = gymnasium.make_vec("OpenOutcry/Hard-v1", num_envs=8)
```

**Trade a real multi-agent market.** In `EndogenousMarketEnv` the agents' aggregate flow *moves* the price they all see (Kyle permanent + Almgren-Chriss temporary impact), not a frozen path:

```python
from openoutcry import EndogenousMarketEnv     # a PettingZoo ParallelEnv

market = EndogenousMarketEnv(n_agents=3, n_symbols=4, n_days=120, seed=1)
obs, infos = market.reset(seed=1)
# every agent submits a target-weight order; the book clears once and the cleared
# price reflects everyone's flow, so one agent's size moves the others' fills.
obs, rewards, terminations, truncations, infos = market.step(
    {a: market.action_space(a).sample() for a in market.agents}
)
```

A one-command [prime-rl](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl) GRPO training config lives in [`examples/prime-rl/`](examples/prime-rl/); see [`docs/training.md`](docs/training.md) for the full loop (install, `vf-eval` baseline, `uv run rl`).

## Use it from anywhere

One Rust engine, scored identically across every surface, because they run the same code.

| Surface | Get it | What it is |
|:--|:--|:--|
| <img height="14" align="top" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/rust/DEA584" />&nbsp; **Rust crate** | `cargo add openoutcry` | The env, the procedural scenario generator, the batched `VecTradingEnv`, the mandate / execution-noise / market-clearing cores, and the governed wire contract, re-exporting the leak-free engine. |
| <img height="14" align="top" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/pypi/3776AB" />&nbsp; **Python** | `pip install openoutcry` | Gymnasium (`Env` + `vector` + registered IDs), PettingZoo (competition + endogenous market), the `verifiers` training env, Minari export, checkpointing, `FuncEnv`, point-in-time-safe wrappers, traces, and an MCP server, over the pyo3 binding. |
| <img height="14" align="top" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/npm/CB3837" />&nbsp; **npm** | `npm i @general-liquidity/openoutcry` | A typed JS/TS API over the engine compiled to WASM. |
| <img height="14" align="top" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/webassembly/654FF0" />&nbsp; **WASM** | `openoutcry-wasm` | The wasm-bindgen bridge the npm package and Gordon (Bun) embed. |

```ts
import { runBaseline } from "@general-liquidity/openoutcry";

// The identical Rust engine, in the browser or Bun: run a baseline over a seeded panel.
const run = runBaseline({
  agent: "momentum",
  dataset: { synthetic: { n_symbols: 4, n_days: 120, seed: 1 } },
  seed: 7,
});
console.log(run.returns.length, run.cost);   // per-period returns + realized execution cost
```

The agent itself can be written in **any** language: a conforming agent is a program that reads `MarketObservation` JSON (stdin or `POST /decide`) and writes `Decision` JSON. Reference agents in Rust, TypeScript, and Python double as the conformance smoke tests ([`crates/openoutcry/examples/`](crates/openoutcry/examples/)).

## The agent contract

The load-bearing standard. An `Observation` is point-in-time; a `Decision` is a set of target-weight orders:

```jsonc
// Observation (harness -> agent)
{ "date": "2025-01-02", "cash": 1.0,
  "symbols": [{ "symbol": "AAPL", "close_history": [187.2, 188.0, 190.4] }],
  "portfolio": [] }

// Decision (agent -> harness)
{ "orders": [{ "symbol": "AAPL", "action": "buy", "target_weight": 0.5 }] }
```

`CONTRACT_VERSION` tracks the wire shape and evolves **additively only** (new fields are optional with defaults), pinned by published JSON Schemas plus a conformance kit. The `validate_decision_json` boundary check rejects malformed decisions before they reach the engine. See [`crates/openoutcry/GOVERNANCE.md`](crates/openoutcry/GOVERNANCE.md) and [`crates/openoutcry/contract/`](crates/openoutcry/contract/).

## Architecture

A Rust [Cargo workspace](Cargo.toml), `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, that **depends on** the published SharpeBench engine rather than vendoring it, so the env and the benchmark cannot drift.

## Governance

The contract is governed in the open: additive-only evolution, a published deprecation window, and a conformance badge (see [`GOVERNANCE.md`](crates/openoutcry/GOVERNANCE.md)). Hosted by [General Liquidity](https://github.com/general-liquidity) to start; the credibility is the leak-free-by-construction substrate plus recompute-to-verify trajectories, not trust in the host. Gordon (GL's agent) conforms to the contract like any other entrant.
